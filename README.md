# battleship-console-nodejs
This little console app goal is to simulate the Battleship boardgame using console;

planned: 
display the board in the console and update it (clears the screen before printing next)
randomly assign battleships on the board
randomly shooting the ships set on the board
counts the number of turns elapsed
display how many shots to do before all ships sunk
set a time delay between each shot so the changes are visible

board is 10x10
board contains 4 ships:
DD = 2 length
CL = 3 length
BB = 4 length
CV = 5 length
randomly assigned, AND can be either horizontal or vertical, also randomly assigned
